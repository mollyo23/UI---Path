# UI-Path
Information on UI-Path

A software solution that enables you to automate your back office repetitive tasks. It converts tedious tasks into complete UI automation, making your work easier and faster. 

UiPath Workflow Design: Comes with a visual way of setting up automation using flowcharts and diagrams. Helps you create a workflow that will model processes of your business operations. 

Boxes and shapes represent each activity process. The arrows indicate the order of the execution and the orange triangle lets you branch the workflow depending on different inputs. An activity is a piece of action you can add to your workflow. An example of this is clicking the OK button or typing text in an input box. 

Benefits:
1. 100% error reduction
2. 65+% cost reduction
3. 75+% cycle time reduction

UiPath Studio: An advanced tool that enables you to design automation processes in a visual manner, through diagrams. 

UiPath Robot: Executes the processes built in studio like a human would. Robots can be unattended or assistants. Unattended means the robots would run in the environemnt without human supervision, whether that is virtual or not. Assistants are when a human triggers the process. 

UIPath Orchestrator: Web application that enables you to deploy, schedule, monitor and manage robots and processes while business exception handling is available through centralized work queues. 

Workflow types and activites: 
1. There are multiple types of workflows avilable to help you build your automation according to your needs. To create the workflows you need activites, actions you use to automate apps such as clicking and typing. These activites allow you to interact with web browsers, desktop apps, PDFs, images, excel, email accounts and many more. 

Recorder Functionality:
1. The easiest way to creat a workflow is to use the recorder feature. There are 4 types of recorders avilable: Basic, Desktop, Web, and citrix. The first two basic and desktop allow you to automate desktop applications. Web and Citrix allow you to handle web apps and virtual environments. 

Variables and .Net functions:
1. A variable allows you to store a value but only of a certain type. .Net functions can be used to help enhance your automation. Such as .Trim which removes the spaces from the beginning and end of a string or .Tostring which transforms a certain type of variable into a string. 

Robots and Orchestrator:
1. Orchestrator is used to manage multiple deployed robots. This is usually found in large enterprises that need to automate many business processes. You can run a process on one or multiple robots, a specified number of them or on all the robots that are grouped in an environment. 

Assets and Queues:
1. Since robots might need to share information a special kind of variable is introduced in orchaestrator assets. These allow you to store information in the web app's database, so that changing a value that is used in multiple processes becomes easy and multiple robots can have access to it. 
2. Queues are used to distribute the load of a transactional process among multiple robots. The can be scheduled to occur at a certiain date and detailed information contained in each queue item can be viewed. 

Logs, Audit, Alerts and Others:
1. Logs tab allows you to see how the robots performed and what jobs were completed and failed. Ever step carried out by the user can be automated.
